What is Independent Mobility?
Mobility Provides Independence
Gaining independent mobility is a key milestone in achieving a greater sense of autonomy and freedom. It allows individuals to take charge of their daily routines, explore new places, and participate in various activities without  transportation assistance. This newfound independence builds self-esteem, enhances decision-making skills, and fosters a sense of empowerment, opening doors to a world of possibilities.
Become Independently Mobile
The ETA program guides you on a journey to independent mobility, ensuring you understand the benefits, find the best mobility option for you, and have the tools needed to start getting around independently. 
1
Understand the Benefits
Independent mobility empowers individuals to access essential services, pursue vocational and educational opportunities, and engage in social activities without relying on others. It fosters a sense of confidence and self-reliance when someone is able to navigate the world independently. Additionally, it opens new possibilities for personal growth, exploration, and building meaningful connections within the community.
2
Find your Mobility Fit
There are lots of different ways to get around independently including walking, riding a bike, taking a bus or train, and even driving. The ETA program will help you discover which of these options is best for your family.
3
Prepare to be Mobile
Once you identify the mobility option to pursue, there are many steps you can take to get ready. The ETA program offers resources like video training, at-home activities, and daily living tasks (like budgeting) to help develop the skills needed for independent mobility.
