Build a secure, bilingual (English/Spanish) web platform for CHOP’s ETA program to support families of neurodivergent adolescents (autism and ADHD) as they plan for independent mobility and navigate the learning-to-drive process. The application is primarily for parents, with secondary support for teens and professionals, and must be structured around four interactive intervention modules across two phases: Pre-Permit Support (1) Preparing for Independent Mobility—life skills assessment with guided coaching and (2) Making Driving Decisions—decision support with risk assessment; and Learning-to-Drive Support (3) Learning to Drive Support—parent training video curriculum plus telecoaching capability and (4) Alternative Mobility Options—non-driving pathway planning with community resources.

Core functionality includes: user onboarding and authentication; role-based access (parent/teen/professional/coach/CHOP staff); real-time assessments that generate individualized recommendations; progress tracking with milestones and motivation features; Family Empowerment Scale with automated scoring and analytics; permit acquisition tracking; curated video series with accessibility features; and an AI-assisted coaching experience that answers family questions and recommends actionable, evidence-based steps, grounded in CHOP-approved content (RAG with guardrails and safe fallbacks).

An administrative backend for CHOP staff is required to manage users and roles, configure research studies (including participant management and randomization), update and publish module content (including bilingual content), monitor engagement and outcomes through dashboards, and export research-ready datasets (CSV) for statistical analysis and grant reporting. The platform must be designed for HIPAA/FERPA-aligned operation, including secure data handling, audit trails for all sensitive actions (admin changes, exports, AI interactions metadata), and readiness for security reviews and penetration testing.
